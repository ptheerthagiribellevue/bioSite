        Tansi's commitment to her hobbies extends beyond personal growth. She actively engages in social activities and communities related to her passions. In Karate, she has evolved from being a participant to assisting in teaching beginner classes, deepening her understanding and skills while inspiring others on their own journeys. Similarly, swimming meets and club activities provide her with opportunities for social interaction and bonding within the swimming community. Her passion for reading led her to become a member of the Speech and Debate club, where her love for literature plays a significant role in her engagement with this activity.
